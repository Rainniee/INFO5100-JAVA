/**
 * The Hand class is the most difficult one to write, because it includes many of the rules and the strategy for playing the game. 
 * Since each player’s identification should remain constant after that player has been instantiated, make NUM a final instance variable
 * and initialize it in the Hand constructor with a value equal to the constructor’s first parameter value. 
 * The second parameter is the maximum number of cards the player will receive. 
 * Use it for the base-constructor call argument.
